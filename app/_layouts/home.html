      <p>We introduce a two-stream model for dynamic texture synthesis. Our model is based on pre-trained convolutional networks (ConvNets) that target two independent tasks: (i) object recognition, and (ii) optical flow prediction. Given an input dynamic texture, statistics of filter responses from the object recognition ConvNet encapsulates the per frame appearance of the input texture, while statistics of filter responses from the optical flow ConvNet models its dynamics. To generate a novel texture, a noise input sequence is optimized to simultaneously match the feature statistics from each stream of the example texture. Inspired by recent work on image style transfer and enabled by the two-stream model, we also apply the synthesis approach to combine the texture appearance from one texture with the dynamics of another to generate entirely novel dynamic textures. We show that our approach generates novel, high quality samples that match both the framewise appearance and temporal evolution of an input example.</p>

      <p>We applied our dynamic texture synthesis process to a wide range of textures which were selected from the <a href="http://dyntex.univ-lr.fr/database.html">DynTex</a> database as well as others collected in-the-wild. Here we provide synthesized results of over 50 different textures that encapsulate a range of phenomena, such as flowing water, waves, clouds, fire, rippling flags, waving plants, and schools of fish. Unless otherwise stated, both target and synthesized dynamic textures consist of 12 frames.</p>
      <p>The top row consists of the target dynamic textures while the bottom row consists of the synthesized dynamic textures. Scroll horizontally to view more.</p>

      <h3>Success cases</h3>
      <p>Inputs which follow the underlying assumption of a dynamic texture, i.e., the appearance and/or dynamics are more-or-less spatially/temporally homogeneous, allow for better synthesized results.</p>
